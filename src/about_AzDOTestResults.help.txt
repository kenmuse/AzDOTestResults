SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Provides functions for retrieving Test Results attached to a build in Azure DevOps

LONG DESCRIPTION
    This module downloads the test results (TRX files, code coverage, etc.) associated
    with a build in Azure DevOps. Additionally, the dependencies of the TRX file can
    will be restored using the directory structure specified in the TRX, optionally being
    restored into a directory structure which is user-configurable. By default, the directory
    convention is organized to support third-party testing tools and uses the format:

    $trxFolder/In/$folder

    The specific directoy convention for TRX dependencies utilizes two special variables:

    Variable                       Description
    ------------------             -------------------
    $folder                        The directory structure specified in the TRX file
    $trxFolder                     A directory name based on the name of the TRX file
                                   with the file extension removed and spaces replaced
                                   with underscores.
